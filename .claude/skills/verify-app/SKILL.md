# Verify app

A green gate is necessary, not sufficient: it says nothing about the screen or
route you changed.

1. Start the app the way
   [getting-started.md](../../../docs/contributing/getting-started.md) says, on
   a fresh or seeded local dataset. Never against production data.
2. Create the data the change needs first. A passing health check or sign-in
   proves nothing about the changed surface.
3. Drive the changed surface. For HTTP, assert on content, not only status. For
   UI, use browser automation at a realistic viewport and exercise the changed
   flow plus one edge case (empty state, a second user, bad input).
4. Watch the server log and browser console for errors while you do it.
5. After deploy (when policy allows), confirm `/health` on the deployed origin
   reports the merge sha.
6. Record what you ran and what you saw in the PR's Testing section, with a
   screenshot for UI changes.

If you write the same driver script twice, add a tool in `tools/` with a test
instead; that is the trigger for an app CLI in
[growth.md](../../../docs/contributing/growth.md).
