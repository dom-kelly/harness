description: >
  Review data, issues, code, and git history; present options with effort and
  one-way/two-way door labels; recommend one path and name the right fix
  (explain if they differ). Use before implementing when a decision needs
  evidence-backed options, or when the user asks "what should we do about X".

# Review and recommend

1. Find the **core problem**. A user's suggested solution is a clue, not the
   spec. Restate the problem and who has it.
2. Check the **evidence**: usage data, logs, or issues where they exist, for how
   many users hit this and how often. Say so when no data exists.
3. Review the relevant code, docs, decision records, issues, and git history.
   Check [decisions/index.md](../../../docs/contributing/decisions/index.md)
   first — do not re-propose a recorded "no" unless its revisit-if is met.
4. Present real options, numbered, each with effort (`Easy` · `Medium` · `Hard`)
   and a **one-way door** (hard to reverse) or **two-way door** (reversible)
   label. Note when an option could be made reversible (keeping old data, a kill
   switch) and what that costs.
5. Make a **recommendation**.
6. Name the **right fix**. If it differs from the recommendation (for example,
   the right fix is too costly right now), explain why.
7. Stop and wait for a choice. Do not implement.
