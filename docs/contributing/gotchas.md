# Gotchas

Real mistakes and their fixes, one line each. If a gotcha can become a checker
or a test, make it one and delete the line.

- Git hooks run with the shell's default `node`, not the one your session
  selected; native bindings (oxlint) are installed for the Node in `.nvmrc`. The
  hook checks the major version first and prints the fix.
- Other agents may be working in a repo at the same time (`git worktree list`).
  Stage files by explicit path, never `git add -A`; do branch work in your own
  worktree; check for an existing PR before opening one.
- A review bot's status badge can stay "in progress" after its review is posted,
  and it pauses itself after a run of commits. Read the PR timeline for the
  review on the current head SHA, not the badge.
- `npm link` hides packaging bugs: a linked package runs from its real path, so
  `.ts` entry points work there and fail from `node_modules`
  (`ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING`). Trust the pack-and-install
  lane, not a linked run.
- Claude Code reads hook exit 1 as "not blocking", so a hook command that cannot
  start must map its failure to exit 2 (`"onFailure": "block"` does the same
  natively on 2.1.295+, timeouts included) except on Stop, where exit 2 only
  sends the agent back to a repair it cannot make. `npx <name>` consults the
  public registry unless `--no-install`; an unrelated `harness` package exists
  there (without a bin today, so the symptom was a silent exit 1).
- A symlink in the repo breaks `git stash` (used by lint-staged) with "beyond a
  symbolic link"; keep copies and a test that they match.
- npm records a GitHub git dependency as an SSH URL in the lockfile whatever the
  spec says, and SSH needs a key even for a public repo, so a CI runner fails
  `npm ci` with "Permission denied (publickey)". Rewrite `ssh://git@github.com/`
  to HTTPS in CI (the validate template does).
- kody is licensed FSL-1.1-ALv2 (GitHub shows "Other"), which permits
  non-competing use. Kent's Kody-platform packages carry no licence of their
  own.
