# External services

Every account, app, and integration the project depends on. Agents read this
instead of guessing which services exist. Never put secret values here; name
where each secret is stored.

Columns: what the service is for, how it connects, where its secrets or config
live (names only), who owns the account, and how to recover access if the
owner's login is lost (password manager entry, recovery codes location, second
admin).

## Setup checklist (once the repo is on GitHub)

1. Enable Cursor Bugbot for the repository in the Cursor dashboard.
2. Optionally install the CodeRabbit GitHub App on the repository.
3. Protect `main`: require the Validate check, require PRs.
