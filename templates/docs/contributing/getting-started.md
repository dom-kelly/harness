# Getting started

Requires Node 22.18 or later (TypeScript runs natively, no build step).

```bash
npm install          # also installs git hooks via husky
npm run dev          # the placeholder app, with /health
npm run validate     # the single gate; read-only
npm run validate:fix # apply formatter and lint autofixes
```

## Agents

An agent setting up the repo does everything it can itself (install, dev,
validate) and only then tells the owner what remains, with the exact command,
for anything that needs a human (secrets, logins, app installs).

## Starting a new product from this boilerplate

1. Run the `new-product` skill with your product idea. It fills
   [project-intent.md](./project-intent.md), reshapes
   [primitives.yaml](./architecture/primitives.yaml), records the first
   decisions, and proposes the first vertical slices.
2. Pick the real stack. Replace `src/` and update the `dev` script and the
   `code` roots in `primitives.yaml`. Keep `validate` as the one gate and keep
   `/health` returning the deployed sha.
3. Add stack-specific checkers only when they encode a rule that was broken (see
   [growth.md](./growth.md)).
